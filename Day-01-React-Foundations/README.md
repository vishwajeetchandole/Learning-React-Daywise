## 📘 Topics Covered
- What is React.js
- Why React is used
- Import & Export in React
- Real DOM vs Virtual DOM
- Setting up a React app using Vite

## 🧪 Mini Project
A simple React page explaining:
- What React is

This project helped me understand how React renders UI efficiently.

## 💡 Key Learnings
- React uses a **Virtual DOM** to improve performance
- Vite makes React setup **fast and lightweight**

## ✅ Outcome
Built my first React app and got comfortable with the project structure and development workflow.
