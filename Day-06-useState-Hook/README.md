# 📅 Day 06 – Exploring `useState` & State Management in React

On **Day 6** of my React learning journey, I explored one of the most important concepts in React — **state management using the `useState` hook**. This day helped me understand how React handles dynamic data and UI updates.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔹 `useState` Hook
- What state is and why it’s needed in React
- How to initialize and update state using `useState`
- How state changes trigger UI re-renders

### 🔹 Updating State Correctly
- Importance of **immutability**
- How to update:
  - Primitive values
  - Objects
  - Arrays
- Avoiding direct state mutation

### 🔹 Batch Updates in React
- How React batches multiple state updates for performance
- Understanding why state updates may feel asynchronous

### 🔹 Event Handling with State
- Connecting UI events (clicks) with state updates
- Writing clean and readable event handler functions

## 🛠 Mini Project – Counter App

To apply these concepts practically, I built a **Counter App** using `useState`.

### ✨ Features:
- ➕ **Increase** button to increment the count
- ➖ **Decrease** button to decrement the count
- 🔄 **Reset** button to reset the count to zero
- Instant UI updates driven by state changes

## 💡 My Approach

- Focused on understanding *how and why* state works
- Practiced writing predictable and clean state logic
- Followed React best practices for updating state
- Kept the UI simple to focus purely on logic

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- `useState` is the backbone of interactive React apps
- State should always be treated as immutable
- Proper state handling leads to predictable UI behavior
- Small projects make learning concepts much clearer

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Moving forward, I’ll continue exploring:
- More advanced hooks
- Component communication
- Real-world mini projects
