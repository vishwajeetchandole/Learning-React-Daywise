# Day 03 – React Props 🔗

On Day 3 of my React learning journey, I explored **Props**, one of the most important concepts in React that enables components to receive and display dynamic data.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- What are Props in React
- Passing data from parent to child components
- Making components dynamic and reusable
- Rendering multiple components using the same structure

---

## 🧪 Mini Project
A **Job Listing UI** built using a reusable **Card component**.

Each card receives data via props such as:
- Company logo
- Job role and job type
- Experience level
- Location
- Salary

The same card component is reused multiple times with different data.

---

## 🧠 My Approach
- Designed a single reusable **Card component**
- Passed job-related data as props instead of hardcoding values
- Rendered multiple cards using the same component structure
- Focused on understanding **data flow** rather than styling

---

## 👍 Why Props Matter
- Make components flexible and reusable
- Help maintain a clear data flow in applications
- Allow the same component to display different data

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Understanding how props are passed and accessed
- Structuring data cleanly for multiple components

These challenges helped strengthen my understanding of component-based architecture.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Props act as a **bridge between components**. Learning props made it clear how real-world React applications stay modular, dynamic, and scalable.

This project helped me move from static components to **data-driven UI**.
