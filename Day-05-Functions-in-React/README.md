# Day 05 – Functions & Props in React

## 📌 What I Learned
On Day 5 of my React learning journey, I focused on understanding how **functions work in React** and how they interact with components using **props**.

### Key concepts explored:
- Writing functions inside React components
- Different ways to define functions
- Passing functions as props
- Calling functions from child components
- Handling button click events
- Understanding how component logic can be reused with props

## 🛠️ Mini Project – Button Actions App

### 🔹 What I Built
A simple mini project with:
- Three reusable **Button components**
- Each button receives:
  - A **label** via props
  - A **function** via props
- Clicking a button displays a **different message on the UI**

---

## 🧠 My Approach
- Broke the UI into reusable components (`Button`, `Message`)
- Kept logic functions in the parent component
- Passed behavior and labels using props
- Focused only on **React fundamentals**, not hooks or advanced state management

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This practice helped me clearly understand:
- How React components communicate
- How logic can be controlled from the parent component
- Why props are powerful for reusability and clean structure

📌 *No hooks were used in this day — purely focused on functions and props.*
