# Day 02 – React Components 🧩

Day 2 was all about understanding **React Components**, the core building blocks of any React application.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- What are React Components
- Why components are important
- Breaking UI into reusable parts
- Creating and using components

---

## 🧪 Mini Project
A simple UI built using:
- **Navbar Component**
- **Card Component** (reused multiple times)

The focus was not on styling but on understanding **how components work and how they are reused**.

---

## 👍 Advantages of Components
- Reusability: Write once, use anywhere
- Clean and organized code
- Easier to maintain and scale applications

---

## ⚠️ Initial Challenges
- Understanding how components connect together
- Structuring files properly

These challenges helped me understand how React apps are actually built.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Learning components changed the way I think about building UIs. Even simple components like a Navbar or Card can make applications more structured and scalable.
